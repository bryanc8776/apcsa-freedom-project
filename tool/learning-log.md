### 10/5/25:
* Watched 10 minutes of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0) video on how to make a game with godot
  * Making in game is combining and extending **nodes** to get the result we want.
  * **Scenes** allow us to bundle nodes together into reusable packages
* We have to download Godot to use it


### 10/20/25:
* Watched 10 minutes of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CrFk3tjsSY) tutorial video which is part of a crash course on Godot.
  * Godot uses multiple languages. The simplest one is GDScript which is similar to Python.
  * You always attach a script to a node and that script can change the attributes of the node.
    * You can change the position, size, color, texture, rotation, or anything the node has in its inspector.
  *  The grid(x, y) starts from the top left(0, 0)
*  I also tried to download the Godot Engine but it didn't work so I'll have to check that.
