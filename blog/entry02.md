#### FP Winter Break Goal
My goal for the winter break is to have fun, spend time with my family and get some rest. However, I also aim to continue learning and practicing my tool. My partner and I plan on making the `Sprites` for the racers which potentially includes 1 player and 3 or more bots. I plan on doing this in the first couple of days of the break.
