#### FP Winter Break Goal
My goal for the winter break is to have fun, spend time with my family and get some rest. However, I also aim to continue learning and practicing my tool. My partner and I plan on making the `Sprites` for the racers which potentially includes 1 player and 3 or more bots. I plan on doing this in the first couple of days of the break.


### Engineering Design Process
I am currently on stage 2 of the engineering designing process. I am learning about the concepts in ***Godot*** and documenting what I find. To fully get a sense of how ***Godot*** works I have tried tutorials and watched videos. Now I am moving on to step 3 which is where we brainstorm possible solutions.
