# Entry 3: Winter Break FP Goal Progress
##### 2/8/26

### Tool Learning


### Engineering Design Process


### Skills
Since the Winter Break, I have improved in **Time management** and **Collaboration**. So far, I have been able to keep up with the work. I have submitted all my work on time and had little procrastination. In my classes, I have greatly improved my ability to interact with others. For example, in AP Calculus, our seats are randomly chosen each day so we sit next to new people everyday. I have to talk with them to confirm answers, ask for help, and help them. I have made new friends with people I never thought I would.
