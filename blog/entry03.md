# Entry 3: Winter Break FP Goal Progress
##### 2/8/26

### Tool Learning
I did not really make significant progress in my Winter Break goal. We had originally planned to create the racers. I was only able to add a folder named cars to my project. This contained two images of sports cars. I tried to add them to a `Node2D` scene and they turned out as `AnimatedSprite2D` sprites. I didn't really understand how to make them real sprites and make them move like I did with the 2D tutorial so I plan on revisiting the library for [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). 



### Engineering Design Process
I am on Step 3 of the engineering designing process. My partner and I are trying to see how we can layout the project and what kind of resources we can use. We need to get car images, see how to map the race, and how to display the score and stats we want.

### Skills
Since the Winter Break, I have improved in **Time management** and **Collaboration**. So far, I have been able to keep up with the work. I have submitted all my work on time and had little procrastination. In my classes, I have greatly improved my ability to interact with others. For example, in AP Calculus, our seats are randomly chosen each day so we sit next to new people everyday. I have to talk with them to confirm answers, ask for help, and help them. I have made new friends with people I never thought I would.
